! Object & Class
----------------------------------------------------------------
Object is instance of a class

object is a self-contained component which contain methods and properties , take memory and address but class didn't need memory and address

object have 3 characteristics, state, behavior and identity

Characteristics state is represented the data of an object
Characteristics behavior is represented the action of an object, such as start, stop, etc.
Characteristics identity is used internally by the JVM (java virtual machine) to identify each object uniquely so the value is not shown to external users
----------------------------------------------------------------
//* Syntax of Class
----------------------------------------------------------------
public class Car {
    private String model;
    private String color;
    private int year;
    public void start(){}
}
----------------------------------------------------------------
//* The explanation
----------------------------------------------------------------
public is a Access Modifier
car is a class name
inside { Class Body }
private String Model is Instance Variables
publuc void start() is Instance Method

----------------------------------------------------------------
//* Creating an Object and syntax
----------------------------------------------------------------
Car myCar = new Car();

//* The explanation

Car in the first syntax is Class Name
MyCar is Object Name
new is creating object keyword
Car() is Automatically Calls Constructor

MyCar itself is reference in the memory that have the value of the car object

----------------------------------------------------------------
! ACCESS MODIFIERS
----------------------------------------------------------------
4 access modifier Default ,Public, Private, Protected

Default not explicitly declared without any private so this can be access as long as in the same package
Public is accessible from everywhere
Private is accessible only declare the class it self, and the most restricted access modifier
Protected is accessible only within the same package and in addition from all subclasses

The level of access modifier

less restricted access modifier is public and protected
more restricted access modifier is default and private

(read from the left, so if public is less so the level of the less public is greater than protected)

----------------------------------------------------------------
! Naming Convention
----------------------------------------------------------------
For the Class Name we should start with uppercase letter, and be a noun e.g. (String,Car,System,etc.)
For the Method Name we should start with lowercase letter, and be a verb e.g. (start(),stop(),actionPerformed())
For the Variable Name we should start with lowercase letter e.g. (firstName,year,color)

----------------------------------------------------------------
! Constructor
----------------------------------------------------------------
Constructor is being used when we want to use the class it self and take the variable from the other to the class it self

----------------------------------------------------------------
! Methods
----------------------------------------------------------------
Methods is function that we used to using the function it self and we don't need to declare variable again

----------------------------------------------------------------
! Package
----------------------------------------------------------------
Structure of package is package<top_package_name>.[sub_package_name]
e.g. (package Vehicle.car;)

//* Type of package
Built in package(For example : java.io)
User defined package(For example : vehicle.car)
