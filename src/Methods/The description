1. what is method?
2. declaration and calling of methods
3. method types
4. method return types
5. method overloading

1. Method is set statement to perform operation, methods is also known as procedures or functions, the advantage is we can use it many times

*ex this is the regular method
int addNumber(int x, int y){

int sum = 0;
sum = x + y;
return sum
}
in java we need to write functions/method like {type of data} {name of function/ method} ({parameters(int x),(int y)}) and for the last we need to write symbol {} and make the rule inside and if we use this functions or method basically we need to use keyword like (return) and what variables that give the return Value.

2. Method Calling

result = addNumber(10,20) // the variable result have a method addNumber with parameter 10,20

3. Method Types

method standard library methods
and the other
method user defined method

System.out.println is a method from library of java it self and addNumber method is a user defined method
All of method is return something
return in java have 2, that is primitive, and non primitive
primitive = char, byte, short, int, long, boolean, float, double
Non-primitive - reference data type like (object of Class, String)

4.Method Return is on the methodExample

5. Method Overloading is when a class has two or more methods same name but different parameters.
